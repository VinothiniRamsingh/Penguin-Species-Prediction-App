# 🐧 Penguin Species Predictor
1. The Penguin Species Prediction App is a machine learning-based web application built with Streamlit.

2. It predicts the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.

3. This app demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained, deployed, and used interactively for predictions in a simple and intuitive way.

   # 🧾 Key features
   1. Island (categorical)
   2. Bill length (mm)
   3. Bill depth (mm)
   4. Flipper length (mm)
   5. Body mass (g)
   6. Sex (Male/Female)
   7. Species (target variable)

   # 💻 How It Works
     1. User inputs penguin measurements in the Streamlit web app.
     2. The app loads the trained ML model. 
     3. Inputs are converted into numerical form and fed to the model.
     4. The model predicts and displays the penguin species instantly.
  
   # ⚙️ Technologies Used
       1. Python 3.x.
